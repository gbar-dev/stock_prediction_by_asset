# Linear Regression Project on Stock Statistics


## Description

This project aims to develop a linear regression model using Python to analyze stock statistics. Linear regression is a powerful statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (in our case, stock prices) and one or more independent variables (various stock-related statistics).

## Objectives

1. **Stock Price Prediction:** The model aims to predict future stock prices based on historical statistics. This can be valuable for investors looking to make informed decisions about their portfolios.

2. **Identification of Influential Factors:** By examining regression coefficients, we can identify the factors that have the most influence on stock price variations. This provides valuable insights for financial analysts and investors.

3. **Model Performance Evaluation:** The project includes a thorough evaluation of the model's performance using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (RÂ²) and root mean square error (RMSE).

## Dataset

The model is built from a dataset that includes historical stock statistics such as trading volume, market capitalization, earnings per share, etc. These data are essential for understanding past trends and establishing meaningful relationships.

## How to Use the Project

### Installation

Clone the GitHub repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gbar-dev/stock_prediction_by_asset.git
cd stock_prediction_by_asset
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Model Training

Train the model using the dedicated script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```
